1. checked vs unchecked
    1) compile it and there is a compile error
    2) look at the hierachy
    3) if you're catching a checked exception, you must ensure the try block
        has a statement that throws the exception (EXCEPT EXCEPTION / THROWABLE)

2. try-with-resource
    try (<instance of AutoClosable>) {

    }

3. files
    -> input
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(...));

    -> output
    Console: System.out.println(...)
    File:    PrintStream out = new PrintStream(FileOutputStream("name", true));
