1. checked vs uncked
    1) compile it and there is a compile error
    2) look at the hierachy

2. try-with-resource
    try (<instance of AutoClosable>) {

    }

3. files
    -> input
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(...));

    -> output
    Console: System.out.println(...)
    File:    PrintStream out = new PrintStream(FileOutputStream("name", true));
